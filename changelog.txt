	Update - 8 (Final + later lang adds) : 30/7/2022 
We as a team of translators for the Serbian language appreciate the chance and the trust of this community and the developers, we are thankful!
I want to give a huge thanks to the whole team (Anri, Petar, skule) for helping a huge portion of the translation process! 

	Update - 9 (We are back!!!) : 29/4/2023 <==== Current!
We as a group of translators for the Serbian language took a collective break do do work and school of any kind. Now that we are somewhat back, 
we are going to try and stay in the loop until the game releases publicly.
We have added all the missing lines and fixed all the one word untranslated lines (99% of the lines are translated), 
and I personally want to thank the team for not completely ditching this game or the translation!
Just hope this gets pushed in the game as soon as possible!
